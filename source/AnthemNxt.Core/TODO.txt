ANTHEMNXT TODOS
===============

- Create $(anthemnxt) JQuery plkugin and make all JS part of that to stop polluting the global namespace.
- Convert all callbacks to JQuery events to avoid merging markup with code where possible.
- Fully automated regression testing
- Remove Anthem core callback code and replace with JQuery $.ajax for maximum code reuse and increased browser compatibility
- Shrink JS where possible (but do not pack - provide PackModule seperately?)
- Update various controls so that they at least work with "viewstate" disabled. Checkbox, hiddenfield and dropdownlist all come to mind.
- Remove the need to have <span> around Anthem controls - as this messes with semantic markup and can play havoc with styling
- Compress/part update viewstate? Not sure if this is possible with encrypted viewstate.
